## 🌍 Story & Narrative

UNI-Bot is a failed prototype abandoned by the UN in a landfill. After unexpectedly rebooting, it discovers fragments of its original mission: restoring nature using sustainable technology.

The city it awakens in is choked by pollution, deprived of sunlight, and populated by residents who have lost hope. Through restoring greenhouses atop three towers, UNI-Bot gradually cleans the sky, bringing back sunlight, clean air, and hope to the city.

**Player Theme:**  
> *“I am the last chance to heal what was destroyed.”*
